AI Support Log – Ad Revenue Studio
Student: Lis Vokshi
Course: Mobile Applications – AAB College (Prishtina)

This log explains where I used AI as support while I was developing the project.
The AI was used mainly for guidance, code review and improvements. All final
decisions, integrations with Supabase, testing, and debugging were done by me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1] Date: 2025-12-02
Topic: Project setup (Expo + GitHub)
Why I used AI:
I asked for help to remember the correct commands to create an Expo project,
initialize Git, and push the first commit to GitHub.
How I used the answers:
I followed the commands step by step in my own terminal and verified that the
project ran on my phone with Expo Go.

[2] Date: 2025-12-02
Topic: Supabase connection (supabaseClient.js)
Why I used AI:
I wanted a clean example of how to initialize the Supabase client in a React
Native / Expo environment.
How I used the answers:
I created `app/supabaseClient.js` myself, copied the suggested structure, and
then inserted my own Supabase URL and anon key. I tested the connection and
fixed any issues directly in Supabase.

[3] Date: 2025-12-02
Topic: Auth screen (login / register)
Why I used AI:
I asked for help with a simple but good-looking login/register screen and the
correct Supabase auth calls.
How I used the answers:
I adapted the provided code to my own design (texts, labels, animations) and
connected it to my Supabase project. I tested registration, email confirmation
and login flows myself.

[4] Date: 2025-12-03
Topic: AdSense revenue calculation logic
Why I used AI:
I wanted a structured way to calculate estimated AdSense and header bidding
revenue (monthly, yearly and traffic growth scenarios).
How I used the answers:
The AI helped with the formulas and some example values. I implemented the
logic in my own component, adjusted the tiers, categories and multipliers, and
verified the results with my own test values.

[5] Date: 2025-12-03
Topic: Website profiles stored in Supabase
Why I used AI:
I asked for ideas on how to model website profiles (name, region tier, category,
monthly pageviews) and connect them to Supabase.
How I used the answers:
I created the `sites` table in Supabase, added row level security policies, and
then wired the insert and select calls in my code. I also designed the UI for
the site list and selection myself.

[6] Date: 2025-12-04
Topic: UI/UX improvements
Why I used AI:
I wanted suggestions to make the app look more professional (cards, theming,
animations, gauge, copy-to-clipboard).
How I used the answers:
I took the ideas and adapted them to my own style: dark/light theme, card
layout, tier buttons, category chips and the RPM gauge. I adjusted colours,
texts and layout manually until I was satisfied with the result.

[7] Date: 2025-12-04
Topic: Dependency issues and Expo compatibility
Why I used AI:
I had warnings about Expo package versions and missing dependencies.
How I used the answers:
AI reminded me of the correct `npx expo install` commands. I ran them in my own
environment, checked the logs and confirmed the app was working again on my
device.

[8] Date: 2025-12-06
Topic: Documentation (README and AI-log)
Why I used AI:
I asked for help structuring the README and this AI-log in a clear and formal
way for my professor.
How I used the answers:
I selected the parts that fit my project, edited the text to match what I
actually implemented, and removed anything that did not reflect my own work.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:
AI was used as a coding assistant (like documentation + example provider). The
full project logic, Supabase configuration, testing on device and final design
were implemented and decided by me, Lis Vokshi.
